#Take care of memory:

Resolve memory warning:
	-Try restart/nil/flush everything after each send.
		-People don't need to look at their prev drawing again, they probably want to send the next one.

Mark:
Consider not restricting to landscape.
	Reason:
	-People like to use one hand.
	-Lots of drawings suited for portrai
	-plus sending landscape images to portrait screen will restrict width.

Consider putting buttons on bottom, easier to reach in both modes.
	Reason:
	-You want people to send more, putting it on bottome increase that chance by a bit.
	
Get rid of save button, just show Send directly.
	Reason:
	-Saving is not useful as there is no load function.
	-Replay is cool, but this adds complexity and marginal utility as the sender knows how it looks anyways as he just drew it.
	-Again, we want people to send fast and often, and not dwell in their work of "art".
